# Xstate React Calculator

++ Added xstate visualiser popup on load. You may need to refresh this page to re-trigger it!

Based on https://github.com/mukeshsoni/statechart-calculator, but upgraded to XState 4.x and refactored by moving all logic to the xstate's machine.

- [XState 4.x](https://xstate.js.org/docs/)
- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [@xstate/react add on](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-react/)
